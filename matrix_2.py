# So How's your coding going on 
#today we will learn something more interesting with help of matrix 
# we will table using python matrix

#so here is the table which i already converted into list
m = [ ["loius" , 26 , "HR"], ["aayush",19,"none"]]

#In this we take credentials of each entry in loop so that we print the the whole table
for i in m:
  print('Name :' , i[0])
  print('age :' , i[1])
  print('Department :' , i[2])
  print('-'*20)
 # Read it carefully as it is littlebit confusing
